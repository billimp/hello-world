# hello-world
A test repository for getting started with GitHub and version control

GitHub is meant to help users understand the flow of their projects, whether for individual use or for use within a team.
By creating branches, one can make edits to one small part of a project, while preserving the integrity of the rest of the project. Then, later on, one's own changes to that small part can be discussed, and even "merged" back into the master branch of that project.
In the meantime, if others are working on other parts of the project while one is focused on a particular branch, others' work can be "pulled" into that particular branch while one continues focusing on that particular branch.
